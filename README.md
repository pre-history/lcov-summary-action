## Features

- Summarizes LCOV reports in GitHub Pull Requests.
- Provides a clear and concise overview of code coverage changes.
- Helps maintain high test coverage by making coverage changes visible in each PR.

## Usage

To use the LCOV Summary Action in your project, add the following to your GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
- name: LCOV Summary
  uses: pre-history/lcov-summary-action@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    lcov-file: ./path/to/your/lcov.info
```

Replace `./path/to/your/lcov.info` with the path to your LCOV report file.

## Permissions

The `permissions` section in the GitHub Actions workflow file is used to control the access level of the GitHub token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) for different scopes. When the `comment-on-pr` input is set to `true` in the LCOV Summary Action, the action will attempt to post a comment on the current pull request with the coverage summary.

In order to do this, the action needs specific permissions:

- `contents: write` allows the action to create, update, and delete repository contents, which is necessary for creating the comment with the coverage summary.
- `pull-requests: write` allows the action to manage pull requests in the repository. This includes creating review comments, which is what the action does when `comment-on-pr` is set to `true`.

Therefore, if you want to use the `comment-on-pr` feature of the LCOV Summary Action, you need to include the following in your workflow file:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```

This ensures that the action has the necessary permissions to post the coverage summary as a comment on the pull request.
